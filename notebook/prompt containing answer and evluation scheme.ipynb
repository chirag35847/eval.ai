    "Air pollution is a major problem that affects the environment and human health. There are several causes of air pollution, including emissions from industries, vehicles, and burning of fossil fuels. These activities release harmful chemicals into the air, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.\n",
    "The effects of air pollution are far-reaching and can lead to serious health problems, such as respiratory diseases, heart problems, and even cancer. In addition, air pollution can harm the environment by causing acid rain, damaging crops, and contributing to climate change.\n",

    "Full marks (5): The answer is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Transitions between ideas are smooth and logical.\n",
    "Partial marks (3-4): The answer is somewhat organized but lacks clarity in some areas or has some awkward transitions.\n",
